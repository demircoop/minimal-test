This my sports injury prevention and rehabilitation app. 
This app has the aim of aiding users prevent new injuries from occurring while playing sports while also helping rehabilitate existing injuries.
The app is currently still missing a few features, but serves as a prototype of my final aim, still functioning as intended.

To run the app, first download Node.js by searching up "Install Node.js"
Then, open command prompt and type "npm install"
Once installed, find the folder the app's contents are in and copy it's file path (click the top of file explorer where the navigation is and copy the file address)
Use "cd (file path)" in command prompt, and then run "npx expo start"
From there, you can either scan the QR code to run it on a mobile device or press "w" to run it through web.
If there are any problems, please contact me ASAP.
